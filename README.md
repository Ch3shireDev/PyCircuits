# Electric Circuits

My small simulation of electric circuits in Python. Believe me or not, it took me a week to find proper solution - idea is to be able go numerically simulate circuits element by element, without looking at a bigger picture.

TODO:

Wire class - any part of the circuit (with given resistance and other parameters, not necessary linear) is described as a simple object. Example is commented, it didn't work exactly well.
